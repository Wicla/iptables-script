This project contains various IPTables-scripts.
Currently they're seperated in two different directories:
 * client
 * server

The server directory contains a script for standalone server (no forwarding)
and one script for gateway (forwarding, TODO).

The client directory contains a script which should be used with clients,
however it was made as a script called by wicd (network manager). Not much
needs to be commented out however to remove that feature, if not needed.
